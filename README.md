# Full Stack Course rep

Currently taking a Web Development course (by Angela Yu from the App Brewery)
and this is the place where I store the codes and projects.

Some of the topics introduced so far:

- Front end development

  - *HTML*
  - *JS*
  - *CSS*
  - *Bootstrap*

- Back end development

  - *jQuery*
  - *Node.js*
  - *EJS*

If you are a newbie like me, hope you can find this helpful to keep going in you
development jurney. If you are a pro, hope this one is helpful to refresh some
basic concepts.

Once I conclude the course, I want to keep developing and giving support to the
projects that I upload here which I find valueble, making them even more
"professional", with the purpuse of, at some point, giving people tools they
can use in a daily basis.

In the meantime, feel free to contribute if you like.

-Erlan.
